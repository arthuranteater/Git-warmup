# Git-warmup

The point of this exercise is to "git" accustomed to a feature-branching workflow in git. 

- Get into a team of 4-5
- Create your own git repository on github
- One person needs to clone down that repository and create three files: index.html, styles.css, and app.js
- Add/commit/push to master.
- Everybody pull down these changes
- Each person needs to create a feature branch
    - `git checkout -b branchName`
    - GIVE YOUR BRANCHES GOOD NAMES
    - Depending on the size of your group, 1 - 2 people should be working on a single file in their respective branches
- The index.html file should have: a header, an image, an unordered list with 5 items, and three empty divs
- The javascript file should target the empty divs, and add whatever you want via the DOM
- The CSS style sheet should style each of these elements that you've created
- Push up to your branch every 7-10 minutes
- Once you've pushed, create a pull request
- Someone else should merge that pull request, then all parties pull 
- DONT FORGET TO COMMIT YOUR WORK BEFORE PULLING
- COMMUNICATE WITH YOUR TEAM
- COMMUNICATION IS V IMPORTANT
- RESOLVING MERGE CONFLICTS IN VS CODE IS THE EASIEST WAY
